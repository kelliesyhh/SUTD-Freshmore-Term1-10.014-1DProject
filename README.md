## Description
This game takes the user through a series of scenarios, simulating a Freshmore student’s life through Term 1. At the start, the user is randomly assigned a character. While all characters have 4 attributes (Health, Money, Social and Intelligence), the initial values of each of these attributes are dependent on the assigned character. Throughout the game, in each scenario, the user’s responses determine the final values of their attributes. Once the game is run, the name of the assigned character, attributes and their respective values are displayed on the top right corner of the screen.

A scenario is marked as such when the user is prompted with a question on screen, and is required to input their choice through the pop-up input box. As mentioned above, the attribute values are updated based on the user’s choice. Some of the choices will result in the activation of mini-games, which serve as bonus opportunities to boost the user’s attribute values. If the values of any attributes fall below 0 points, a particular set of revival questions will be activated, allowing the user to continue with the game if they meet certain conditions (e.g. having a certain other attribute value to be more than half of the initial attribute value). Should the user fail these revival conditions, they will be considered dead and the game will be over.

At the end of the game, the user’s attribute values will be displayed on the screen, acting as a gauge of the user’s decision making skills.

The main objective of the game is to not die before the final question pops up. Ideally, the user should have a balanced set of attribute values, showing that he/she is an all-rounded individual that is healthy, financially stable, decently sociable, and equipped with the right skills (i.e. high intelligence).

When coming up with this game, we took into consideration existing games such as ​Reigns and ​Episode​ / ​Choices​. We wanted to incorporate the choice-based element of these games into the game we designed, while making it more fun and relevant for SUTD students.
